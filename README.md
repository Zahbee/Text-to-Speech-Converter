# 🔊 Text-to-Speech Converter

A simple and fully responsive Text-to-Speech Converter built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This web application allows users to enter text into a textarea and convert it into speech with the click of a button.

## 🚀 Features

- ✔️ Clean and responsive user interface
- ✔️ Converts user input text to speech
- ✔️ Real-time error handling for empty input
- ✔️ Dynamic button feedback while speech is playing
- ✔️ Utilizes the browser's built-in `speechSynthesis` API

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** – to create the structure of the web page
- **CSS** – to style and design a responsive layout
- **JavaScript** – to implement the text-to-speech functionality

## 🎯 How It Works

1. User types or pastes text into the textarea.
2. When the "Play Converted Sound" button is clicked:
   - If the input is empty, an error message is shown.
   - If the input is valid, the text is spoken using the browser's Speech Synthesis API.
3. The button temporarily updates to "Sound is Playing..." and resets after 5 seconds.
